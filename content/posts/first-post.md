# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Blog!

Hey everyone! This is my **first post** on my self-hosted blog.Iâ€™ll be writing about:

- ðŸ’» Tech & coding (Java, React, Go, etc.)
- ðŸ“š Things I learn daily
- ðŸŒ± Personal growth and productivity
- ðŸ§˜ Meditation & fitness journey

---

## ðŸ’¡ Code Snippet Example

Since Iâ€™m a developer, hereâ€™s a simple Java program to kick things off:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world! ðŸš€");
    }
}
```
